### Hi there!

I'm Quinn Gibson (he/him), of Stranothus Studios. I'm a young web developer in the freelance business.

## A little about me

I'm a nearly straight-A 3.85 unweighted GPA homeschool student. I have been taking dual enrollment courses at my local community college since my Sophomore year. I currently take nearly all of my classes at the college and am scheduled to recieve my Associates level degree a semester before I graduate high school. 

I've trained in martial arts for nearly half of my life, taking a break during Covid-19. I successfully tested for my first degree black belt and am looking forward to testing for my second after pre-Covid complications and Covid restrictions. I was priveleged to instruct at my dojo for nearly two years before Covid.

I'm utterly passionate about programming. I code all the time and am always learning more. When I can't get to a computer, I'm still thinking about projects and solutions, even in my dreams.

## My accomplishments:

- Wrote my first program at eleven years old.
- Earned my black belt in karate at eleven after four years of training.
- Began learning front end web development at thirteen. 
- Was writing fully functional and interactive front end websites throughout fourteen and fifteen.
- Learned the basics of backend web development at sixteen with Node JS and Express.
- Developed a fullstack webpage for a client at sixteen.
- Developed and maintain my own fullstack website at sixteen.
- Participated in my first hackathon at sixteen and worked twelve hours on the biggest day.
- Collaborated with a friend to create a custom SASS transpiler.
- Enrolled in an online cyber security course at sixteen.
- Created a BrainF interpreter at sixteen.
- First client website finished and running at sixteen.
- Achieved a spot on the President's list at the community college where I dual enroll at sixteen.
