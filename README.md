I'm Quinn Gibson, of Stranothus Studios. I'm a young web developer in the freelance web development business!

## My accomplishments:

- Wrote my first program at eleven years old.
- Learned Processing JS, a library now replaced with P5 JS, to create JavaScript programs with graphics after just turning twelve. I continued creating programs in Processing JS until I was about fourteen when I moved more towards web development.
- Began learning front end web development at thirteen and really got in deep at fourteen. After a little while, I knew web dev was the kind of programming I wanted to do.
- Founded multiple teams and headed a learning effort to educate other students on the platform I had been working on to learn web development.
- Left my previous learning platform to expand. I have since moved to Repl.it and GitHub.
- Learned the basics of backend web development at sixteen with Node JS and Express early on at sixteen.
- I recently have finished my first fullstack webpage for a client. Just waiting for them to get a domain name and decide on a hosting service now.
- Developed and maintain my own fullstack website
